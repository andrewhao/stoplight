# Stoplight

Given a range of GPX data from a GPS device, return a list of
coordinates that the user is stopped at and for how long.

This type of data is useful for determining a person's longest stops at
which intersections - giving a cyclist a good idea of which stoplights
to watch out for.

## Usage

    $ node runner.js
